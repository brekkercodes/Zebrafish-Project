# Zebrafish-Project
This repository contains code and resources for detecting and analyzing fish behaviors in video footage using computer vision techniques. The project focuses on identifying and tracking multiple fish, detecting specific behaviors such as quivering, egg-laying, and chasing, and ensuring robust detection even in noisy or challenging video conditions.
